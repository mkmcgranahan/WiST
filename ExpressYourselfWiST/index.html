                <div class="description">
                    I was born on September 18, 2000 in Oakton, Virginia.
                    As you can tell from my shades, I was very cool from the start.

                    When I was 5, my family moved to New York City. Sports helped me make friends in the concrete
                    jungle.
                    I played basketball and soccer.

                    While my basketball career consisted of many 0 point seasons,
                    I found success in being able to run up and down the soccer field without getting tired.
                    At the same time, my dad started competing in Ironman triathlons.
                    I decided I wanted to do what he did and entered kids triathlons.
                    The running part of the triathlon was my favorite.
                    In middle school, I joined my first track team.
                    The furthest race we ran was the 800m, but I knew I was built for more distance so I ran 4 mile road
                    races in Central Park with my dad and brother.

                    As much as I enjoyed the thrill of racing, I still loved the team camaraderie of soccer.
                    I captained my 7th and 8th grade travel teams. When I got to high school,
                    I knew cross country was the sport for me.
                    I would be able to compete at a higher level in running, while still having the team aspect
                    I loved so much. My dream was to compete in college

                <div class="description">
                    This has been a pretty smooth race so far, but look at that big hill up ahead.

                    Let's take a quick detour to review some lessons I learned from cross country camp that helped me up
                    all the hills in my running career.
                    I went to Brevard Distance Runners camp as a camper for four years, and later went on to be a
                    counselor. Every year at camp we did a challenging run that went four miles straight up a
                    mountainside.
                    This climb was difficult, but it was also the trail I mae the most friends on. I would find myself
                    running next to state champions and All-Americans, both boys and girls.
                    We were strangers from different schools and states at the time, but would encourage each other up
                    the hills to the amazing views at the top.
                    I realized that on the hills it wasn’t about who was the fastest, but who was willing to persevere
                    and keep making small steps towards the top.
                    No one asked you for your finish times at the end of those runs, it was all about the journey.

                    This race is getting kind of serious and so was I.
                    My junior year of high school I started training with the boys cross country team in order to have
                    more equally matched training partners.
                    It was supposed to be a great opportunity for me, but instead I overtrained every day because I was
                    afraid of failing in front of the boys team.
                    I didn’t take care of myself properly. Eventually, I realized this was wearing me down and I was not
                    getting any faster.
                    I adjusted my mentality, and began to see the boys as my equals, not people I needed to prove myself
                    against.
                    I split my time more evenly between the boys and girls team. Both teams helped me learn to have fun
                    again and
                    the whole process taught me that sometimes easy days help you move forward.

                <div class="description">
                    Only after I learned these lessons did I start to get faster and see results. I had a successful
                    senior year and vowed to spend the rest of my career encouraging other female athletes to take care
                    of their mental and physical health,
                    while also achieving their goals.

                    every cross country meet in high school.
                    It was a team tradition in high school to get a cake every year with a cross country pun on it.
                    Lloyd’s always make me think of the wonderful girls who helped me have fun with the sport again.

                    You're halfway there, which means its time to explore some new trails! In high school I began to
                    explore Computer Science.
                    I loved having a class where I got hands-on experience designing and build things, like this project
                    that would later become a tetris board.
                    I also realized Computer Science gave me the opportunity to work in any field I was interested in,
                    including building technology for the sports that helped me grow into the person I am.
                    I found the same lessons I had learned while running with the boys cross country team
                    would help me persevere through negative gender stereotypes in Computer Science.

                    My senior year of high school, I committed to run Division III at Amherst College.
                    The opportunity to run in college was a dream come true.
                    I loved that Amherst was a place where I could develop as an athlete,
                    while also being able to achieve my academic goals and double major in Computer Science and
                    Economics.

                    When I started at Amherst, I was a freshman working hard just to be one of the seven girls on the
                    team chosen to compete at Regionals for my team.
                    However, I finally had consistent training and was motivated by what I saw our men's team achieving.
                    The men qualified for the national championship every year, and I wanted the women to be able to
                    have that experience too.
                    My career was abruptly interrupted halfway through my freshmen year by Covid.
                    I spent over a year doing all of my runs alone, with no races in sight.
                    That is, until one of the older girls on the team encouraged me to train for and run my first
                    marathon with her.
                    She helped me find the motivation I needed to stay positive during a hard time. She reconnected me
                    with my team and my love for the sport.

                    led the women's team to its first national championship appearance since 2014.

                    As I was hitting my stride in running, I was also gaining confidence in Computer Science.
                    The summer between my junior and senior year I worked my first Software Engineering Internship at
                    Garmin.
                    I was excited to be working for a company whose running watches I had been using since I was a kid.
                    I was assigned to work in IT on the Edge Technology team, a team that dealt with topics I knew
                    nothing about.
                    I quickly learned how my team kept Garmin’s entire network of websites and apps connected.
                    By the end of the summer, I had designed and built a web application, called the Edge Debugging
                    Tool,
                    that helped Garmin developers analyze their applications’ DNS routing.
                    I used Node.js to develop a back-end API that made calls to both proxied public and non-proxied
                    internal DNS resource records
                    and built out an educational user interface.

                    My senior year I was the cross country conference champion and a cross country All-American.
                    I qualified for my first national championship on the track in the 3k steeplechase, an event that is
                    all about perseverance
                    and being the grittiest one in the race.
                    My favorite thing my senior year was realizing
                    I had successfully created a team where the girls under me who did not have to grow up idolizing a
                    mens team.
                    They were instead motivated by watching their own teammates.
                    In addition, it warmed my heart when freshmen boys started coming to me for training advice and
                    support,
                    seeing me as equal to their male captains.

                    My senior year encouraged me to raise my standards for myself.
                    It showed me how much more there was for me to accomplish, in running and Computer Science.
                    I committed to run Division I at Virginia Tech while getting my Master’s in Computer Science.
                    I returned to Garmin for a second internship, but this time to work on the Global Partnerships and
                    Engineering Business Development team,
                    using my interest in business in and my technology experience to learn how a company I admire makes

                    conferences in the country.
                    Now I have three more track seasons to see what I can do. I've started a new race and my next finish
                    line involves a career in sports technology.
                    A WiST fellowship would give me the opportunity to work with a new sports technology company to gain
                    more experience and a better picture of the field as a whole.
                    In addition, it would connect me to more female role models in sports technology.
