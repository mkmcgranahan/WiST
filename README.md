# WiST
WiST Express Yourself Project

This repository serves as the source code for the personal expression component of my WiST Fellowship application. I decided to go back to the high school project that got me hooked on Computer Science and convinced me to continue studying it. My teacher tasked us with creating a website that told a story as the user clicked through it. This was my first truly creative coding project. My personal expression is a website that will take you through something I have done many times before, a cross country race. However, this race is also going to tell you a bit about my story and how I ended up applying to be a WiST fellow.
